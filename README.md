# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation of multiple classifiers to identify the most accurate model for detecting fraud.


## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant issue faced by financial institutions. This project aims to build a model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions. Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, are used and compared based on their performance metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a real-world dataset containing transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It includes a total of 284,807 transactions, where 492 are fraudulent (Class 1) and the rest are legitimate (Class 0).

- **Source**: The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Installation
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib imbalanced-learn joblib
```
